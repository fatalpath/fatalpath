## 🧠 About Me

I focus heavily on **frontend engineering**, especially building clean, scalable, and visually polished user interfaces.

My work revolves around:
- modern UI libraries
- component-driven architecture
- design systems
- performance & UX polish

I enjoy experimenting with new UI patterns and refining interfaces until they *feel right*.
